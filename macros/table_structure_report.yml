  - name: table_structure_report
    description: >
     This macro consists in a dimensional comparison between legacy and refactored table structures,
     featuring the following metrics:
     * row count;
     * number of columns;
     * missing columns in comparison with its counterpart;
     * oldest date of a date column (optional);
     * newest date of a date column (optional).
     The row count and the number of columns comparison subsidize a dimensional analysis of the table by the AE,
     clearly informing about possible missing data between the two tables. The optional date reference column,
     usually a 'date_synced' type column, can bring further detail to a missing data issue, allowing to quickly
     identify if different time intervals are being used between the tables.
    arguments:
      - name: db_connection
        type: varchar
        description: >
         Define the database connector adapter. Right now, this package supports 'snowflake' and 'postgres'
         values for this argument, correspondent to the supported dbt-snowflake and dbt-postgres adapters.
      - name: old_db
        type: varchar
        description: >
         Name of the database where the legacy model is located. Required for bringing information schema data.
      - name: old_schema
        type: varchar
        description: >
         Name of the schema where the legacy model is located. Required for bringing information schema data.
      - name: old_table
        type: varchar
        description: >
         Name identifier of the legacy model. Required for bringing information schema data.
      - name: new_db
        type: varchar
        description: >
         Name of the database where the refactored model is located. Required for bringing information schema data.
      - name: new_schema
        type: varchar
        description: >
         Name of the schema where the refactored model is located. Required for bringing information schema data.
      - name: new_table
        type: varchar
        description: >
         Name identifier of the refactored model. Required for bringing information schema data.
      - name: date_column
        type: varchar
        description: >
         Name of the date column to be evaluated between both tables. Note that the columns need to have the same name
         in the legacy and in the refactored table. The column renaming can be done within the old_query and new_query
         arguments.
